          Inception is a sci-fi thriller directed by Christopher Nolan that explores the concept of dream manipulation and shared dreaming. 
          Dom Cobb, a skilled thief, is offered a chance to have his criminal record erased if he can successfully perform an inception — planting an idea in someone's mind without them realizing it.
